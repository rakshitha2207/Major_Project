# Prometheus.ai - Multi Model Voice Assistant

Prometheus.ai is a multi-model voice assistant that leverages the power of AI to understand and respond to user prompts. It uses a combination of speech recognition, natural language processing, and image processing to provide a comprehensive and interactive user experience.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Prometheus.ai listens to the user's voice and transcribes it into text.
- **Natural Language Processing**: It uses the GROQ API to understand the context and generate a response to the user's prompt.
- **Image Processing**: It can take screenshots or capture webcam images and analyze them to provide context to the user's prompt.
- **Text-to-Speech**: It uses the Edge TTS to convert the generated response into speech.

## Installation

2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Click the "START" button on the Streamlit interface to start the voice assistant.
